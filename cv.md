## Summary

Self-educated __*Junior Front End Developer*__. JavaScript and frameworks I learned about a year at home, under control of Senior Full-Stack Developer. During my self-education I’m using "JavaScript. The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan in 5th edition for theory, and web-resources for theory and practice.
I’m fast-learning and ready to get along with new frameworks and technologies. I‘m sociable, in а conflict situation I always seek a compromise to resolve a conflict without an escalation.  
About 7 years I worked in Advertise Design, and later had a little experience in QA.

I’m looking for a new experience to implicate my current knowledge and improve it. In my opinion, junior Frontend developer would be perfect opportunity to learn on practice and to learn being useful. Further I’m planning to do my best, and to move step-by-step to Senior level of knowledge and experience.
