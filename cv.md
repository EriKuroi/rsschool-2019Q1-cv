## Summary

Self-educated __*Junior Front End Developer*__. JavaScript and frameworks I learned about a year at home, under control of Senior Full-Stack Developer. During my self-education I’m using "JavaScript. The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan in 5th edition for theory, and web-resources for theory and practice.
I’m fast-learning and ready to get along with new frameworks and technologies. I‘m sociable, in а conflict situation I always seek a compromise to resolve a conflict without an escalation.  
About 7 years I worked in Advertise Design, and later had a little experience in QA.

I’m looking for a new experience to implicate my current knowledge and improve it. In my opinion, position of Junior Frontend developer would be perfect opportunity to learn on practice and to learn being useful. Further I’m planning to do my best, and to move step-by-step to Senior level of knowledge and experience.

## Languages

I started to learn English myself alongside with the standard school course, when in 5th form I changed a school in-depth study of French language to school, where English was the only foreign language to teach. In two years I made up lost ground to level of pupils, who learned English from 1st form, and successfully passed the examination to class with intensified English teaching. Then I had English as main foreign language in the Institute of Law. Ever since I was in school, I'm been reading books in English, listening to music of English-speaking musicians, watching some videos, and, from time to time,  communicating with English-speakers. After I had graduated BIP, I episodically gave lessons of English to adult novices. Now I give 16-lessons course based on D. Petrov educational system, for adults, who want to begin speak English berore long. Since I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I also began to read educational materials and courseware in English. Though my result of English tests is B1, I still have no problem in live communications in English.

Other languages I studied in descending order of experience:

* French
* Japanese
* Polish
* Spanish
